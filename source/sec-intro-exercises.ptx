 <title>Data Visualization Introduction Activity</title>

 <p>
Go to the following link, and use the data in the document to create a visualization: <url href="https://bit.ly/47BYPhc" /> to an external site.

</p>


<p>
    

Rules:

<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            You may not use ALL the data. Choose some that you want to highlight.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            You can create your visualization using anything you want. (Draw on paper, use Excel, Desmos, etc.)
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            I want you to think about how the following two questions:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        What do you notice about the data?
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        What do you wonder about the data?
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>


</p>

<p>

(It's okay if your visualization doesn't look perfect!  We'll be talking a lot more about creating visualizations in the coming weeks -- this is just to get started creating something and thinking about what data you want to highlight.)

</p>

<p>

(Here is a link to the checklist referenced in the document that you can look at if you'd like, but you do not need to:  <url href="https://bit.ly/45cFilX" /> to an external site.)

<exercise>
    <title>Dow Jones Data</title>
    
    <p>
Open up the file <q>Dow Jones Industrial Average Historical Data</q> below:

<url href="external/sheets/Dow Jones Industrial Average Historical Data.xlsx" />
    </p>



    <p>
Create a graphic depicting the price over time so the viewer can gain some insight into the relationship.

</p>

<p>

If you finish this, here are some other things you can think about:

<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            Is there a way you could modify your graph that might help the viewer more easily see what is happening?
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Think about if there is a different graphic you could create using this dataset that would provide useful insight. 
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Are there any questions that you have about the data?  (Are there any calculations you could do that would give you a better understanding of the data?)
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>

</p>
