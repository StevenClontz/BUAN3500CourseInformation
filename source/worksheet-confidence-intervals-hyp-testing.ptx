  <title>Confidence Intervals and Hypothesis Testing Worksheet</title>


  <p>
    Our goal is to use a sample to understand what is happening in our population.  We are going to focus on estimating means and proportions for our population using a sample.

  <subsection xml:id="subsec-conf-int-mean">
    <title>Confidence Intervals for the Mean</title>

    <p>
        Cases that we need to consider separately:

        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Population standard deviation (<m>\sigma</m>) is known:
                    <me>\bar{x}\pm z_{\alpha/2}\left(\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\right)</me>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Population standard deviation (<m>\sigma</m>) is not known, and we only know the sample standard deviation:
                    <me>\bar{x}\pm t_{\alpha/2}\left(\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}\right)</me>

                </p>

    <title>Hypothesis Testing</title>

    <p>
        We have shown how a sample could be used to develop a point and interval estimates of population parameters such as the mean (<m>\mu</m>) and the proportion (<m>p</m>).  Now we will continue the discussion of statistical inference by showing how hypothesis testing can be used to determine whether a statement about the value of a population parameter should or should not be rejected.

<exercise>
    <p>
    We want to test the hypothesis that the proportion of households in the US in which someones owns a business or a farm is <m>10.4\%</m> using the US Census sample data from October 2023::  <url href="https://bit.ly/3SskrqA" />

    </p>
    <p>
       (This data can be found at <url href="https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/time-series/demo/cps/cps-basic.html" />.)
    </p>

    <p>
        (Look at <q>HUBUS</q> like we did in <xref ref="ex-Census-confidence-intervals"/>.)
    </p>

    
<p>
Determine the null and alternative hypotheses and find the test statistic.
</p>
<p>
    Then find the p-value and decide what you can conclude based on this sample.
